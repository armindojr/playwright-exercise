# Playwright Exercise

## Description
Training playwright automation skills with dummy website

## Motivation
I've created this exercise to improve and train my skills with `Playwright`, using a well known dummy website to do basic things on frontend that can possibly be used on another website or scenarios.

## Cloning and running the project
- You must have git installed and configured correctly
